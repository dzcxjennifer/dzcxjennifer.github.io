# About
I am a second year PhD student in Operations Research at Stanford University.

I received my bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (with Departmental Citation) from UC Berkeley. During undergrad, I was fortunate to conduct research under the supervision of Anil Aswani, Abhishek Nagaraj, and Cheng Ren.
