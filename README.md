## About Me

I am a first year PhD student in Operations Research at Stanford University. I received my bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research from UC Berkeley, where I was fortunate to conduct research under the supervision of [Anil Aswani](https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/anil-aswani), [Abhishek Nagaraj](https://www.abhishekn.com), and [Cheng Ren](https://www.albany.edu/ssw/faculty/cheng-ren).
