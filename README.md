## About Me

I am currently a senior at UC Berkeley majoring in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research. At Berkeley, I am fortunate to conduct research under the supervision of [Anil Aswani](https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/anil-aswani), [Abhishek Nagaraj](https://www.abhishekn.com), and [Cheng Ren](https://www.albany.edu/ssw/faculty/cheng-ren).
